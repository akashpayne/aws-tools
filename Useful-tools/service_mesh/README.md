- A service mesh is a configurable, low‑latency infrastructure layer designed to handle a high volume of network‑based interprocess communication among application infrastructure services using APIs.
- A service mesh ensures that communication among containerized and often ephemeral application infrastructure services is fast, reliable, and secure.
- The mesh provides critical capabilities including service discovery, load balancing, encryption, observability, traceability, authentication and authorization, and support for the circuit breaker pattern.
