# CloudTrail Insights

CloudTrail Insights detects unusual activity by analyzing CloudTrail _**write**_ management events within an AWS
account and a region. 
An unusual or abnormal event is defined as the volume of AWS API calls that deviates from what is expected from a 
previously established operating pattern or baseline.
